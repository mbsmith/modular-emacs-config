* Mastodon, and other tidbits

** Mastodon

Just a little package for browsing mastodon.  I don't use it much, but
it's deferred and doesn't take much space.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "social.el"
(use-package mastodon
  :defer t
  :config
  (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://mastodon.social"
        mastodon-active-user "xulfer"))
#+end_src
