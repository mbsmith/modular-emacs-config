* Terminal

I've been using [[https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat][eat]] (Emulate A Terminal) in place of vterm lately as it has
better emacs integration without too big of a performance hit.  It doesn't
handle fancy terminal applications quite as well, but so far has performed
well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package eat
  :ensure (:type git
                 :host codeberg
                 :repo "akib/emacs-eat"
                 :files ("*.el" ("term" "term/*.el") "*.texi"
                         "*.ti" ("terminfo/e" "terminfo/e/*")
                         ("terminfo/65" "terminfo/65/*")
                         ("integration" "integration/*")
                         (:exclude ".dir-locals.el" "*-tests.el")))

Many of these settings are there to reduce flickering.  They may not be needed
long term.
