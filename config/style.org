* Look and Feel

I've already touched on some appearance settings so far, but I feel themes and
such deserve their own space.

** Themes

I'm currently only using solarized light as it seems to be the most readable
theme. Perhaps I might toggle light/dark mode based on time, or lighting in
the future.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package color-theme-solarized
  :ensure (:host github 
                 :repo "sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized"
                 :files ("*.el"))
  :no-require t
  :init
  (customize-set-variable 'frame-background-mode 'dark)
  (load-theme 'solarized t))
#+end_src

I like using catppuccin from time to time as well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package catppuccin-theme :ensure t)
#+end_src

** Modeline

Doom emacs has a great modeline in my opinion so I'm using theirs almost
as is.  It comes with some pretty nice customization features should it be
necessary.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package doom-modeline
  :defer 2
  :config
  (doom-modeline-mode)
  :custom
  (doom-modeline-time-analogue-clock nil)
  (doom-modeline-time-icon nil)
  (doom-modeline-unicode-fallback nil)
  (doom-modeline-buffer-encoding 'nondefault)
  (display-time-load-average nil)
  (doom-modeline-icon t "Show icons in the modeline"))
#+end_src
