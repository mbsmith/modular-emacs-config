* Keeping things tidy

I'd like to keep all of my configuration, and emacs files in one place.  I've found
the [[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering][no-littering]] package does this well.  This keeps everything under the .emacs.d
directory rather than littering $HOME.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package no-littering
  :ensure t
  :config
  (no-littering-theme-backups)
  (let ((dir (no-littering-expand-var-file-name "lock-files/")))
    (make-directory dir t)
    (setq lock-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,dir t))))
  (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory)))
#+end_src
