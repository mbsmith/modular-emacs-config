* Garbage Collection

There's a lot of clashes that can happen with regards to performance, and
garbage collection.  There are a lot of [[https://emacsredux.com/blog/2025/03/28/speed-up-emacs-startup-by-tweaking-the-gc-settings/][settings]] improvements that can make
a huge difference in this regard.  Especially when it comes to LSPs,
completion, and the like.  I've chosen to let GCCH (Garbage Collector
Magic Hack) to handle this.  It seems to work pretty well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Garbage collection
(use-package gcmh
  :ensure t
  :hook (after-init . gcmh-mode)
  :custom
  (gcmh-idle-delay 'auto)
  (gcmh-auto-idle-delay-factor 10))
#+end_src
