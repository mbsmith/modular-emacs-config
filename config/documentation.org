* Documentation

If possible I like to have documentation within the editor itself so
I can easily read and look at the material easily.

** devdocs.el

This [[https://github.com/astoff/devdocs.el][plugin]] browses documentation from [[https://devdocs.io][devdocs.io]].  I haven't used this
enough to vouch for it's accuracy, but it seems fine.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package devdocs
  :ensure t
  :bind ("C-h D" . devdocs-lookup))
#+end_src
