* Path

Rather than having to manage potential paths in the configuration I'll use the
[[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]] package.  This pulls in =$PATH= from various different shells
and operating systems.  At least BSD, Linux, and MacOS are supported anyway.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :ensure t
  :config
  (when (memq window-system '(mac ns))
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)))
#+end_src
