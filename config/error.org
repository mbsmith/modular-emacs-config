* Error Checking

** Flycheck

I've found flycheck to be an excellent checker.  Capable of interacting with
many backends at once.  Be they linters, or LSPs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package flycheck
  :ensure t
  :init (global-flycheck-mode))
#+end_src

Of course it's always useful to have a debugger handy.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dap-mode :defer t)
#+end_src
