* Socializing

Here are some things I use to optionally communicate with the rest of the world
via Emacs.  I keep them in separate files so I can optionally load them easily
on a system by system basis.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; Extra optional files

(defun maybe-load-rel (relpath)
  "Loads a file relative to the user-emacs-directory fi it exists."
  (let ((path (concat (file-name-as-directory user-emacs-directory) relpath)))
    (when (file-exists-p path)
      (load-file path))))

(maybe-load-rel "extra/email.el")
(maybe-load-rel "extra/feed.el")
(maybe-load-rel "extra/social.el")
;;;
#+end_src
