* Snippets

Snippets can be helpful in many situations.  However they can also get in the way.
This is my *attempt* at making them helpful in most cases.

** YASnippet

[[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet?tab=readme-ov-file][YASnippet]]  is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an abbreviation
and automatically expand it into function templates.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package yasnippet
  :hook (prog-mode . yas-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC

For now I'm just using [[https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets][YASnippet-snippets]] to provide all of my snippets.  Custom
ones may be added in the future.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package yasnippet-snippets
  :after (yasnippet)
  :init (yas-reload-all))
#+END_SRC
