* Auth sources

I make sure the auth sources are within the emacs directory.  I use gpg, but in case there's
a plain text one laying around I'll use that too.  Finally as I use pass I've enabled
password-store as well;  Though I'm not sure this actually works currently.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(auth-source-pass-enable)
(setq auth-sources '("~/.emacs.d/.authinfo.gpg" "~/.emacs.d/.authinfo"
                     "password-store"))
#+end_src
